### Challenges Faced in the completion of Project

<details>
<summary>Styling Challenges</summary>
<br />

Styling the components to achieve the desired layout and appearance was challenging for me. CSS could sometimes be tricky, especially when dealing with complex layouts and responsive design. However, I overcame these challenges by experimenting with different CSS properties and values to achieve the desired visual outcome.

<summary>Component Integration</summary>
<br />

Integrating multiple components to create a cohesive user interface was a challenge for me. However, I overcame it by ensuring that each component interacted correctly with others and maintained data flow.


Navigating through different libraries and frameworks to find the best solutions added another layer of complexity, but I tackled it by thoroughly researching and testing various options until I found the most suitable ones.
